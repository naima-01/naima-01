## Hi, I'm Naima!

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Math. I’m passionate about combining art and technology to create thoughtful, human-centered digital experiences. With a strong interest in ethical tech and AI, I’m especially drawn to projects that explore creativity, design, and social impact through code.
